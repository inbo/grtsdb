  abstract = {Sampling of a population is frequently required to understand trends
	and patterns in natural resource management because financial and
	time constraints preclude a complete census. A rigorous probability-based
	survey design specifies where to sample so that inferences from the
	sample apply to the entire population. Probability survey designs
	should be used in natural resource and environmental management situations
	because they provide the mathematical foundation for statistical
	inference. Development of long-term monitoring designs demand survey
	designs that achieve statistical rigor and are efficient but remain
	flexible to inevitable logistical or practical constraints during
	field data collection. Here we describe an approach to probability-based
	survey design, called the Reversed Randomized Quadrant-Recursive
	Raster, based on the concept of spatially balanced sampling and implemented
	in a geographic information system. This provides environmental managers
	a practical tool to generate flexible and efficient survey designs
	for natural resource applications. Factors commonly used to modify
	sampling intensity, such as categories, gradients, or accessibility,
	can be readily incorporated into the spatially balanced sample design.},
